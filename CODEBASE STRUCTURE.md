These are the directories that we are actively using in the development:

+ [frontend/server/controllers](https://github.com/kylelobo/The-Documentation-Compendium/tree/master/frontend/server/controllers): 
The controllers do the business logic and expose the server API.
+ [frontend/server/libs](https://github.com/The-Documentation-Compendium/tree/master/frontend/server/libs): Libraries and 
utilities.
+ [frontend/server/libs/dao](https://github.com/The-Documentation-Compendium/tree/master/frontend/server/libs/dao): Data 
Access Objects [DAO] and Value Objects [VO]. Classes used to represent database schemes and facilitate their use by the controllers.
+ [frontend/templates](https://github.com/The-Documentation-Compendium/tree/master/frontend/templates): Smarty templates 
used to generate the HTML that is displayed to users.
+ [frontend/www](https://github.com/The-Documentation-Compendium/tree/master/frontend/www): The complete contents of the 
Internet page.
+ Any more files and their descriptions...
