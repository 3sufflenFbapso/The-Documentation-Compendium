## Why must you document your project?<a name = "why_document"></a>
+ You will be using your code in 6 months. Code that you wrote 6 months ago is often indistinguishable from code that someone else has written
+ You want people to use your code because you think that others might find it useful. However, people need to understand why your code might be useful for them, before they decide to use it
+ You want people to help out. If you donâ€™t have documentation, you will miss out on a whole class of contributors.
+ You want to be a better writer

## The DO's and DON'Ts of Documentation<a name = "dos_and_donts"></a>
DO'S:
+ Keep a lighthearted friendly tone. Treat the reader as a close friend who doesn't have a lot of knowledge about the topic but is very interested
+ Keep things brief
+ Use headings frequently. This breaks things up when reading and often it is good for linking to specific information
+ Link to other places in the documentation often but only for additional information. Readers should not have to navigate through several pages to find the information that they need about one specific thing. Just inline the immediately relevant information and link off if they want to know more
+ Use as many code snippets, CLI, etc. examples as possible. Show the reader what you mean
+ Gently introduce a guide before diving into technical details. This gives context and readers are more likely to stay engaged longer
+ It is always good to describe the functionality of the various files in your project

DON'TS:
+ Don't assume prior knowledge about the topic. If you want to appeal to a large audience, then you are going to have people with very diverse backgrounds
+ Don't use idioms. Speak using more formal terms that are well defined. This makes it easier for non-native English speakers and for translations to be written
+ Don't clutter explanations with overly detailed examples
+ Use terms that are offensive to any group. There will never be a good reason to
