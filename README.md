## ü§î Why must you document your project?<a name = "why_document"></a>
+ **THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE GLANCE AND LEAVE.** Make it pretty so that it's easier for them to star before they leave. The more stars you have, the likelier it is that serious developers will use your repo.
+ You will be using your code in _6 months_. Code that you wrote 6 months ago is often indistinguishable from code that someone else has written
+ You want people to use your code because you think that others might find it useful. However, people need to _understand why_ your code might be useful for them, before they decide to use it
+ You want people to _help out_. If you don‚Äôt have documentation, you will _miss out_ on a whole class of contributors.
+ You want to be a _better_ writer

## üö¶ The DO's and DON'Ts of Documentation<a name = "dos_and_donts"></a>
**‚úîÔ∏è DO'S:**
+ Keep a lighthearted friendly tone. Treat the reader as someone who doesn't have a lot of _knowledge_ about the topic but is very interested
+ Keep things _brief_
+ Use _headings_ frequently. This breaks things up when reading and often it is good for linking to specific information
+ Link to other places in the documentation often but only for additional information. Readers should not have to navigate through several pages to find the information that they need about _one specific thing_. Just _inline_ the immediately relevant information and link off if they want to know more
+ Use as many code snippets, CLI, etc. examples as possible. Show the reader what you mean
+ Gently _introduce a guide_ before diving into technical details. This gives context and readers are more likely to stay engaged longer
+ It is always good to describe the functionality of the various files in your project

**‚ùå DON'TS:**
+ Don't assume _prior knowledge_ about the topic. If you want to appeal to a large audience, then you are going to have people with very diverse backgrounds
+ Don't use _idioms_. Speak using more formal terms that are well defined. This makes it easier for non-native English speakers and for translations to be written
+ Don't clutter explanations with overly detailed examples
+ Don't use terms that are _offensive_ to any group. There will never be a good reason to
